    "Some people call themselves \"foodies\" maybe simply because it is a trendy word to use when posting pictures of food on social networks. To be frank, I never put the \"foodie\" label on myself, but I am the type of person would travel for good restaurants. In my eyes, cities are made of not only sightseeing spots but also food---ethnic, casual, local fast food, fine dining, you name it.\n",

I will try to experiment with different level of granularity in terms of the categories of restaurants because from what I observed in the lab of week3, the categories of restaurants are very sparse for NYC neighborhoods.  \n",

    "After all the pre-processing, the restaurants will be encoded and pass to the KNN cluster model using scikit-learn library, which will then cluster cities based on categories of restaurants.
